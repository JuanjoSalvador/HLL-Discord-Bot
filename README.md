# HLL Discord Bot

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Installation

1. Create a bot account to get an API key that we can use later. You can follow [this instructions](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) to learn how to create one.
2. Deploy the app to Heroku (highly recommended) or any other platform that supports Python apps.
3. [OPTIONAL] If you're not deploying it to Heroku, after get the code into your platform, follow the specific platform instructions to deploy Python apps. Many of this kind of platforms should make it automatically.
4. Go to next step on configuration guide.
